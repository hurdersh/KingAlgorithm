# TODO

This file lists the main improvements and future tasks for the **King Algorithm Implementation** project. Each item is a planned enhancement to improve usability, automation, and functionality of the system.

## Planned Tasks

1. **Use DALI IDs for Communication**

   * Refactor the code to properly use DALI agent IDs for message passing and coordination.

2. **Automated AgentRoundSimulator Generator**

   * Create a Bash script that takes user input (e.g., number of agents) and automatically generates the code for the `agentRoundSimulator`.

3. **Byzantine Agents Implementation**

   * Add code for Byzantine agents, currently simulated manually, to automate and extend the testing scenarios.

4. **Simple GUI Visualization**

   * Develop a lightweight graphical interface to visualize rounds, agent messages, and consensus progression.

5. **Automated Rounds with DALI Delays**

   * Implement round automation by using DALIâ€™s delay features, removing the need for manual event triggering.
